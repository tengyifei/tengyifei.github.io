<p>
It has been quite a while since my last article. I am now studying at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, meeting amazing people everyday. This does not mean however that I will not dedicate my time to this blog. The readers (i.e. you guys) are my best support.
</p>
<p>
Back to business, my quadcopter project has been progressing steadily. I hope to write another update following <a title="PCB for Kolibri Quadcopter project" href="http://www.thinkingandcomputing.com/2014/04/07/pcb-kolibri-quadcopter-project/" target="_blank">the initial one</a>. The assembly of airframe is almost complete. My quad now boasts a 6000mAh 3S battery, 4-in-1 ESC, and full carbon fiber fuselage and propeller. As you can see, I went to great lengths to make the craft as light as possible to maximize flight time. Without further ado, here it is:

<p>
The frame looks vaguely similar to the Talon V2 from HobbyKing. In fact it is a hybrid of different airframes. The arms are indeed from a salvaged Talon. The landing gear is from a heli model, while the battery holders and PCB adapters are fashioned from thin carbon fiber boards.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
The next picture shows the internals. Flanked by the flight control board and the base is the Quattro ESC. This a very special ESC in that it integrates four controller circuits onto a single PCB, thus saving power and space. The three phase wires from the ESC are conveniently routed through the inside of the hollow arms, yielding a rather slick appearance as opposed to a bunch of exposed wires.
</p>
<p>
The flight control module is sandwiched between large number of diverse rubber dampers. I intend to keep vibration minimal so as to reduce the noise in accelerometers and gyroscopes. There is a Sharp IR sensor mounted on top to do some rudimentary collision avoidance, which will be improved as I add another three of them using the traces left on the PCB beforehand.

<p>
I was initially worried that the magnetic field from the ESC would severely interfere with magnetometer readings. But it turned out that this is not an issue. The ESC switches at a frequency so high that the magnetometer, whose measurement time averages at the order of 10 milliseconds, could barely detect the difference.
</p>
<p>
That’s about all. See you next time, when I may upload some actual flight video!
